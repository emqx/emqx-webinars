Step 0 - Demo Setup
    - Download Docker Ubuntu image 20.04
         https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu​

    - Create and start Docker container  emqxee_u  // Docker file at c:\dev\emqxee\SingleNodeEE\dockerfile

    - Downlod and install EMQ X Ubuntu 20.04 on docker container
         https://www.emqx.com/en/try?product=enterprise​

    - At emqx/etc:  mkdir certs2
       cd certs2
       Download scripts from:  https://github.com/zmstone/tls-scripts
       Put them in the certs2 directory


step 0.1 Demo initialization
         Do these when rerunning demo to return it to an initialized state

       In certs2: delete subdirectories "local" and "cloud" if they exist   // They will be created when generating certificates

       Edit emqx/etc/listeners.conf  to be correct but missing files    // This will demonstrate hot configureation without need to restart broker
         listeners.ssl.external.keyfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server.key
         listeners.ssl.external.certfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server-fullchain.pem
         listeners.ssl.external.verify = verify_none

         listeners.wss.external.keyfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server.key
         listeners.wss.external.certfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server-fullchain.pem
         listeners.wss.external.verify = verify_none

       Edit emqx/etc/plugins/emqx_dashboard.conf   to be correct but missing files
         #dashboard.listener.https.keyfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server.key
         #dashboard.listener.https.certfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server-fullchain.pem
         #dashboard.listener.https.verify = verify_none  (make sure commented)


- Open Windows Terminal and create following tabs
   - Tab "Host":  cd \demo\tls
                  mkdir certs2                           // Make the directory if it doesn't exist
                  If certs2 exists:
				        Delete all certificates and keys from local and cloud directories
                  cp getCerts.bat certs2                 // If it does not already exist in the directory
                  cp converClientToPxf.bat certs2/local  // If not already there

   - Tab "Workflow": docker exec -it emqxee_u bash
                   export PS1="\u: \w > "
                   cd emqx/etc

- In MQTTX  (optional)   // The demo starts with these created to show TLS connections cannot connect
                         // Otherwise this can wait until they are needed in the test section
    Create Local and Cloud collections
    Create 4 clients in each collection of each possible connection type
    Clear their history to erase any previous messages    // Three dots (upper right corner) then Clear History

        Cloud-WS            client4             WS          8083    False

    Verify that MQTT and WS clients can connect

    In EMQX Cloud: Overview page:
       Delete TLS/SSL Config
       Connected Ports should show only 1883(mqtt), 8083(ws)

    // Verify that the certificates are not valid
        openssl s_client localhost:8883     // SSL    Will see write:errno=104    no peer certificate available
        openssl s_client localhost:8084     // WSS    Will see write:errno=104    no peer certificate available
        openssl s_client localhost:18084    // HTTPS  Will see connect:errno=111


    - In Windows
        Remove "MyRootCA" from Trusted Root Certificate Authorities
           Windows: Search "cert"  Control Panel > certmgr > Trusted Root Certificate Authority > Certificates
		   Remove "MyRootCA" and Intermediate certificates from the Personal tab  certmgr > Personal 

_____________________
step 0.2 Check before demo that everything is initialized 
That everything was set up correctly
        In MQTTX
            Local and Cloud groups with four clients in each group using all four connection types
            Plaintext clients connected but not the others
            Payload to testtopic/1
                {
                    "temperature_c": 25.0,
                    "temperature_f": 77.0,
                    "level_m": 7.947214,
                    "speed_kmh": 158.9443
                }
        Dasboard of local broker at localhost:18083 should show 2 clients (Local-TCP, Local-WS) as logged in
        Dashboard of cloud:
                TLS/SSL Config should be empty and only connections shown: 1883(mqtt), 8083(ws)
                should show 2 clients (Cloud-WS, Cloud-TCP) as logged in

        Windows Terminal: Host, Workflow, Certs2, Config, Etc   // Clear and show only the directory contents
            Host: at c:\demo\tls\certs2
                   clear  //
                   ls     // Should show getCerts.bat  convertClientToPxf.bat  and cloud and local directories
				   ls local  // should have only convertClientToPxf.bat
				   ls cloud  // should be empty

            Workflow: at /opt/emqx/etc
                    clear; ./workflow.sh steps

            Certs2: at /opt/emqx/etc/certs
                   clear
                   ls     // Should show all the script .sh files but no local or cloud cirectory

            Config: at /opt/emqx/etc
                   clear
                   ls

            Etc: at /opt/emqx/etc
                   clear
                   ls

        In etc/listeners.conf and plugins/emqx_dashboard.conf
			Verify that the parameters are set to one-way TLS 
			
		In Windows
            Search "cert" > Manage User Certificates > Trusted Root Certificate Authorities > Certificate
            MyRootCA should not be shown
_____________________
------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - Generate Certificates
step 1.1 Set certificate parameters
    In the emqx/certs2 directory
        source env-config.sh      // This will set up the environment variables for the local certificates

_____________________
step 1.2 generate certificates for local and cloud 
        ./generate-certs.sh       // This will generate the local certificates
        ls                        // Notice that there is a new directory with a timestamp name: 2022-01xxx:xx:xx
        mv 2022-01xxx:xx:xx local // Rename this directory to "local"
        ls local                  // Verify that the certificate files have been generated
        source env-config.sh cloud  // This will set up the environment variables for the cloud certificates
       ./generate-certs.sh       // This will generate the local certificates
        ls                        // Notice that there is a new directory with a timestamp name: 2022-01xxx:xx:xx
        mv 2022-01xxx:xx:xx cloud // Rename this directory to "cloud"
        ls cloud                        // Verify that the certificate files have been generated
        ls                        // Verify that there are two directories: local and cloud

_____________________
------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 - Examine Certificates and Verify keys
// To get a basic understanding of what the files contain
    In the certs2/local directory   // Run the scripts from the local directory
        ../trace.sh ca.pem          // Examine the root certificate
        ../cacerts_show.sh | grep "MyRootCA"    // Verify that MyRootCA is not in the EMQ X cacerts file

        ../trace.sh server.pem      // Examine the subect, issuer fields

          // Verify that server-fullchain forms a complete correct chain to the root certificate
        ../trace.sh server-fullchain.pem
        ../show.sh server-fullchain.pem | grep -iA4 X509  --color   // Examine the X509 extensions
        ../show.sh server-fullchain.pem | grep -iA2 validity  --color​   // Verify the dates are valid
        ../verify.sh server         // Verify that the server keys are valid   Assumes server.key  server.pem
                                    // key_cert_verify.sh  accepts any two key/certificate file name

        // Repeat the above for the client files
      // Repeat for the files in the certs/cloud directory
            // Note that the ca.pem files may look the same but they are different files and cannot be mixed
             In the certs2/cloud directory:
                ../show.sh  ca.pem | grep -iA1 "serial number"
                ../show.sh  ../local/ca.pem | grep -iA1 "serial number"
                Note that the serial numbers are different

            // Note that cloud/server-fullchian.pem is using a Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
            // So you need to look at the X509 extensions to verify the full chain
            From the certs2/cloud directory
              ../trace.sh server-fullchain.pem
              ../show.sh server-fullchain.pem | grep -iA4 X509  --color   // Examine the X509 extensions

------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 - Map EMQ X (on-prem and cloud) parameters one-way TLS to the certificate files
step 3.1 Map EMQ X on-prem parameters one-way TLS to the certificate files (local directory)
    In the emqx/etc directory
        nano listeners.conf         // or use your favorite editor
        Edit the following parameters as shown
         listeners.ssl.external.keyfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server.key
         listeners.ssl.external.certfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server-fullchain.pem
         listeners.ssl.external.verify = verify_none

         listeners.wss.external.keyfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server.key
         listeners.wss.external.certfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server-fullchain.pem
         listeners.wss.external.verify = verify_none

    In the emqx/etc/plugins directory
        nano emqx_dashboard.conf   // or use your favorite editor
        Edit the following parameters as shown
         dashboard.listener.https.keyfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server.key
         dashboard.listener.https.certfile = /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/server-fullchain.pem
         dashboard.listener.https.verify = verify_none

    The broker will automatically load the certificates in a few minutes
    To force the broker to load the certificates immediately
        emqx/bin/emqx stop                  // Execute emqx stop in the bin directory
        emqx/bin/emqx start
        You should see a successful startup message

_____________________
step 3.2 Copy docker image certificate files to host computer
    For the dockeers demo, the certificate files need to be copied to the host
        On the host computer, in a terminal window
        cd <some direcory on the host >     // Choose a directory to download the certificate files to
        copy the getCerts.bat script to the directory
        copy the converClientToPxf.bat script to the directory
        getCerts.bat 2                      // This will get all the certifiates from the docker directory: /opt/emqx/etc/certs2


_____________________
step 3.3 Map EMQ X cloud parameters one-way TLS to the certificate files (cloud directory)
    For EMQ X Cloud
        In your browser
        Open your EMQ X Cloud deployment
        In the Overview page > TLS/SSL Config section > Add TLS/SSL Config
        In TLS/SSL Type choose one-way
        Using the Upload button add the following files.  Make sure to add them from the cloud directory
            Certificate body: cloud/server.pem
            Certificate chain: cloud/server-fullchian.pem
            Certificate private key: cloud/server.key
        Press Confirm
        You should see TLS/SSL status as pending.
        In a few minutes it will change to running

_____________________
------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 - Test certificates using openssl s_client
    In EMQ X on-prem
    In the emqx/etc/certs2/local directory      // First test the on-prem broker
        ../sclient-ssl.sh                       // Verify SSL contain
        The first line shows the s_client command called from the script
        openssl s_client -CAfile /opt/emqx/etc/certs2/local/ca.pem -verify_hostname localhost -tlsextdebug -state -debug -connect localhost:8883
        To see less verbose output remove -tlsextdebug -state -debug
        You should see a lot of verbose output including:  // You shoud not see any errors
            Verification: OK
            Verified peername: localhost
            Verify return code: 0 (ok)

        ../sclient-wss.sh                       // Verify the wss connection
        You should see a similar output to the above

        ../sclient-https.sh
        You should see a similar output to the above

        ../sclient-wss.sh | grep errno          // check for errors
        The output will not be what you expect  // The s_client command writes to both stdout and stderr, but grep is filtering only stdout

        ../sclient-wss.sh 2>&1 | grep errno     // This routes stderr to stdout before being piped to grep
            read:errno=0                        // After a few seconds you should see this.  errno=0 is ok

------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 - Test certificates using MQTTX
    In MQTTX
      If not already created
        Click New Collection and ceate Local and Cloud collections
        Create 4 clients in each collection of each possible connection type. Click the plus + icon to create the clients
        Click Connect to connect each client to its broker
        Local
            Host: Domain for EMQ X on-prem (example: localhost)

            Name/Client ID      Username/Password   Host        Port    SSL/TLS                           CA File
            Local-SSL           Local-SSL           MQTTS       8883    True, Self signed, SSL Secure     local/ca.pem
            Local-WSS           Local-WSS           WSS         8884    True, Self signed, SSL Secure     local/ca.pem
            Local-TCP           Local-TCP           MQTT        1883    False
            Local-WS            Local-WS            WS          8083    False

        Cloud
            Host: Domain for EMQ X Cloud  (example: s1....amazonaws.com

            Name/Client ID      Username/Password   Host        Port    SSL/TLS                           CA File
            Cloud-SSL           client1             MQTTS       8883    True, Self signed, SSL Secure     cloud/ca.pem
            Cloud-WSS           client2             WSS         8884    True, Self signed, SSL Secure     cloud/ca.pem
            Cloud-TCP           client3             MQTT        1883    False
            Cloud-WS            client4             WS          8083    False

        For each client
            Click New Subscription
            Leave the Topic as the default testtopic/# and press confirm

        All clients will now be subscribed to topic testtopic and all subtopics
        Verify that the cloud clients and their subscriptions are listed in EMQ X Cloud Monitor page
        Verify that the local clients and their subscriptions are listed in EMQ X on-prem Clients and Subscriptions page

        Choose one of the clients in the Local group.
        Paste the following message in the Payload section.
            {
                "temperature_c": 25.0,
                "temperature_f": 77.0,
                "level_m": 7.947214,
                "speed_kmh": 158.9443
            }
        Press the green button (lower right corner) to publish the message.
        Verify that all clients in the Local group receive the message.
        (You should see the message for the selected client and a "1" for all other clients that received the message.
        Select each client with a "1" and verify that they have received the message
        Repeat for a client in the Cloud group and verify that all clients in that group received the message

----------------------------
Step 6 - Add root CA certificate to browser and test HTTPS
    In a browser
    Navigate to https://localhost:18084
    Microsoft Edge: Click Not Secure > Your connection to the site isn't secure > Show certificate icon (upper right)
    Chrome: Click Not Secure > Your certificate is not valid
    Click Certificate path and select MyIntermediateCA-1
    Click View Certificate
    Notice that issuer is MyRootCA      // MyRootCA  needs to be added to the browers trusted roots

    For Chrome:
        Three dots (upper right corner) > Settings
        In search, type "cert"
        Security > Manage Certificates
        Trust Root Certificate Authorities

    For Edge:
        In browser: edge://settings/privacy
        In search: type "cert"
        Manage Certificates
        Trusted Root Certificate Authorities

    In Certificates dialog box
        Selected Trusted Root Certificate Authorities
        Verify that MyRootCA is not included in list        // Remove it if it is
        Click Import
        Follow wizard instructions
        Browse to local/ca.pem                  // May need to set file type to All Files to see it
        Confirm import
        Verify that MyRootCA is in the list
        Restart browser
        Navigate to https://localhost:18084     // Verify that lock symbol is shown
        Click lock symbol
        Navigate to Certificate Path and verify that the MyRootCA is also shown


------------------------------------------------------
Step 7 - Change brokers to use two-way TLS
    In EMQ X on-prem
    In the emqx/etc directory
        nano listeners.conf     // Edit the listeners.conf file
        listener.ssl.external.verify = verify_peer            // This forces two-way TLS for ssl connections
        listener.ssl.external.fail_if_no_peer_cert = true     // Fails if clients does not send a certificate

        listener.wss.external.verify = verify_peer            // This forces two-way TLS for wss connections
        listener.wss.external.fail_if_no_peer_cert = true     // Fails if clients does not send a certificate

    The broker will automatically load the certificates in a few minutes
    To force the broker to load the certificates immediately
        emqx/bin/emqx stop                  // Execute emqx stop in the bin directory
        emqx/bin/emqx start
        You should see a successful startup message

    For EMQ X Cloud
        In your browser
        Open your EMQ X Cloud deployment
        In the Overview page > TLS/SSL Config section
        Click the trash can icon to delete the existing one-way TLS connection
        Click Add TLS/SSL Config to add a two-way TLS configuration
        In TLS/SSL Type choose two-way
        Using the Upload button add the following files.  Make sure to add them from the cloud directory
            Certificate body: cloud/server.pem              // Same file as for one-way TLS
            Certificate chain: cloud/server-fullchian.pem   // Same file as for one-way TLS
            Certificate private key: cloud/server.key       // Same file as for one-way TLS
            Client CA certificate:  cloud/ca.pem            // New file for the client CA root certificate
        Press Confirm
        You should see TLS/SSL status as pending.
        In a few minutes it will change to running

Step 8 - Test two-way TLS
step 8.1 Test two-way TLS with MQTTX
    In MQTTX
        For all clients:
            Disconnect the clients          // Disconnect icon located at upper rightcorner
            Clear the previous messages if desired    // Three dots (upper right corner) then choose Clear History
            Attempt to reconnect the client // SSL clients will not connect
        SSL clients will not connect    // Need to add the client certificate and private key file
        For the Local SSL clients
            Click the edit icon         // Edit icon located at upper right corner
            Add the following files:
                Client Certificate File: local/client-fullchain.pem
                Client key file: local/client.key
            Click connect and the client should connect

        For the Local Cloud clients
            Click the edit icon         // Edit icon located at upper right corner
            Add the following files:
                Client Certificate File: cloud/client-fullchain.pem
                Client key file: cloud/client.key
            Click connect and the client should connect

        All the clients should now be connected (shown in green)
        Note: MQTTX will automatically subscribe the clients to their subscribed topics
        Verify that the cloud clients and their subscriptions are listed in EMQ X Cloud Monitor page
        Verify that the local clients and their subscriptions are listed in EMQ X on-prem Clients and Subscriptions page

        Choose one of the clients in the Local group.
        Paste the following message in the Payload section.
            {
                "temperature_c": 25.0,
                "temperature_f": 77.0,
                "level_m": 7.947214,
                "speed_kmh": 158.9443
            }
        Press the green button (lower right corner) to publish the message.
        Verify that all clients in the Local group receive the message.
        (You should see the message for the selected client and a "1" for all other clients that received the message.
        Select each client with a "1" and verify that they have received the message
        Repeat for a client in the Cloud group and verify that all clients in that group received the message

step 8.2 Test two-way TLS with HTTPS in browser
    In your browser:
        Connect to https://localhost:18084 and verify that you cannot connect
        This is because you have not included your client certificate in your browser

    You need to add the client-fullchain certificate to the browser
    Depending on your operating system, you may need to convert it from pem to another format such as pxf
    On the host computer
       Copy the convertClientToPxf.bat script to the same directory as the local certificate files
       convertClientToPxf.bat       // This will convert the client-fullchain.pem file to client-fullchain.pxf

    The client-fullchain.pxf file will be added to the Personal certificates
    For Chrome:
        Three dots (upper right corner) > Settings
        In search, type "cert"
        Security > Manage Certificates
        Personal

    For Edge:
        In browser: edge://settings/privacy
        In search: type "cert"
        Manage Certificates
        Personal

    In Certificates dialog box
        Personal
        Verify that the MyIntermediateCA-2 is not already in the list  // Remove it if it is
        Click Import
        Follow wizard instructions
        Browse to local/client-fullchain.pxf     // May need to set file type to All Files to see it
        Confirm import
        Verify that MyIntermediateCA-2 is in the list
        Restart browser
        Navigate to https://localhost:18084
        The browser will prompt you to choose your personal certificate
        Choose your certificate
        You should now be connected to the local dashboard using two-way TLS/SSL
